A collection of small and simple applications that show how to do various things with the Haiku API. You can use them to learn the Haiku API or to begin writing your next Haiku application.

You can contribute. It's easy!

Are you learning how to use the Haiku API? Are you creating little example applications that never leave your computer? Please consider donating them to this project. I could give you commit access, or you could simply email me your code. You will retain the copyright, but I ask that it be licensed under the MIT license.

Many of the examples come from the excellent Haiku tutorial books by DarkWyrm.
