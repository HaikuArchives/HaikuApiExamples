This is a collection of source code for small applications for Haiku.

Each application shows one specefic feature of the Haiku programming API. All of the source code is well documented, to help you know why a command does what.

You may freely use the source code to learn how to program for Haiku better, or to simply get a quick start on writing a new application.
